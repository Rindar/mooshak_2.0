Layout Conventions:
	Write only one statement per line.
	Write only one declaration per line.
	Indent equals one tab.
	Curly-brackets start and end in a new line.
	All operators should be preceded and followed by a space.
	Use perentheses to increase readability ex.  if((y > 10) || (y == c))
	
	if(x == 4 && p == d || x < 28)

	for(int i = 0; i > 3; i++)
	
	if ((val1 > val2) && (val1 > val3))
		
	{
		// Take appropriate action.
	}

	if(something > something)
	{
		someStatement;
	}

	

Commenting Conventions:
	Begin comment text with an uppercase letter.
	End comment text with a period.
	Comments not at the right-side of code.
	Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//).
	Multiline comments use (///).

Naming Conventions:
	camelCasing for variables and functions.
	PascalCasing for ClassNames.
	All names should express their meaning.
	
LINQ Queries
	Use meaningful names for query variables.
	For each operation in a LINQ query, create a new line
		ex.
		from cust in customers
                where cust.City == "Seattle"
                select cust.Name;
